# Things To Be Done
A simple ToDo List app. 
The user could add a task to do and set its priority. However the task priority will change to conform the deadline to finish the task!

## Main goals for the v1.0

The main goal is to create an app that could be scalable for a second version by implementing MVVM+Coordinator pattern. Also, this app will allow a further understand on how to use CoreData by creating a self strategy to handle it.

### This app will implement:

- [ ] Coordinator Pattern
- [ ] MVVM Pattern
- [ ] DispatchQueue
- [ ] CoreData
- [ ] NIB files (for v1.0)
